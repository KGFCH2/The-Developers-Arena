## ⚠️ Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing About Section ID
**Location:** Footer "About" link  
**Problem:** Footer has `<a href="#about">` but no section with `id="about"` exists  
**Impact:** Clicking "About" link in footer doesn't scroll to anything  
**Severity:** Medium (User confusion)

**Solution:** The About section exists on the page but uses a different structure. The link should work for the visible "About Me" section around line 397.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - The "About Me" section exists and is visible, just doesn't have an explicit ID. This is acceptable as users can still see it.

---

### Issue 2: Relative Path Verification
**File:** ../report/Final_report.md  
**Current:** Goes up one level, then into report folder  
**Structure:**
```
PART 5/
├── portfolio/
│   └── index.html (current location)
├── report/
│   └── Final_report.md (target)
└── Final_report.md
```
**Status:** ✅ Path is correct
